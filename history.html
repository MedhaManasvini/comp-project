<p>Women in ancient Sumer (an ancient civilization) could buy, own, sell, and inherit property. They could engage in commerce, and testify in court as witnesses.<br>
Female deities, such as Inanna, were widely worshipped. The Akkadian poet Enheduanna, the priestess of Inanna and daughter of Sargon, is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded. </p>

<h4> Egypt </h4></dt>
<dd>
<p>In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon social class. <br>Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property. Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in legal contracts, be executors in wills and witnesses to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.</p>

<h4> India </h4></dt>
<dd>
<p>Women during the early Vedic period enjoyed equal status with men in all aspects of life. Works by ancient Indian grammarians such as Patanjali and Katyayana suggest that women were educated in the early Vedic period. Rigvedic verses suggest that women married at a mature age and were probably free to select their own husbands in a practice called swayamvar or live-in relationship called Gandharva marriage.
