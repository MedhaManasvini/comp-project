Women across the globe have struggled for ages to have rights over family properties. In various societies, the philosophy behind frowning upon the thought of giving property rights to women was that they do not permanently stay in their birth family. Once married, they move into their marital families and become a part of it. So, only the male members had rights over their family properties. However, women’s property rights have significantly evolved in the past couple of decades. Let’s try to understand women’s property laws and their rights in India.

The Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act, 1937 </dt>
<dd>
 The Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act, 1937 predominantly dealt with the property rights of Hindu widows. It allowed a Hindu widow to receive an equal share in her intestate husband’s property as her sons. However, it failed to address the issues pertaining to the property rights of women as a whole; also, it did not give coparcenary rights to Hindu women.  </dd>

Representation of the People Act, 1950</dt>
<dd>This Act provides for the preparation and revision of electoral rolls, the conduct of elections, and the determination of the qualifications of voters.</dd>
<br>
<dt> 
The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005</dt>
<dd>It eradicated the age-old discriminatory practice of keeping women out of the coparcenary system. <br>
Section 6 of the 1956 Act vests equal rights and liabilities on both the sons and daughters of a coparcener. Section 6(1) provides that the daughter of a coparcener:
<ul>
   <li> Has the same rights in the coparcenary property as she would have had if she had been a son;</li>
    <li>Has the same liabilities in respect of the coparcenary property as that of a son. </li> </ul> </dd>
