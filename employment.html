India has several laws and other measures to promote equal employment for women, including: 
<dl>
<dt>
Equal Remuneration Act, 1976</dt>
<dd>
This act mandates that women and men receive equal pay for equal work. It was subsumed into the Code on Wages, 2019. </dd>
<dt>
Constitution of India</dt>
<br>
<dd>The Constitution's fundamental rights guarantee equality of opportunity in employment and prohibit discrimination based on sex. Articles 14, 15, 15(3), 16, 39(a), 39(b), 39(c), and 42 are particularly relevant.</dd>
<br>
<dt> 
Protection of Women from Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act</dt>
<dd>This act was enacted to protect women's fundamental rights in the workplace. However, it only addresses sexual harassment and doesn't cover gender-based discrimination unless it's combined with sexual harassment. </dd>
<br>
<dt>State laws</dt>
<dd>Some states have laws that require establishments to provide protection for women's dignity, honor, and safety. These laws may also mandate facilities like shelters, restrooms, and night cr√®ches. </dd>
<br>
<dt>Startups and companies</dt>
<dd>Some companies, like Amazon, Mahindra Logistics, Uber, and Ola, have created job opportunities for women in their delivery and driving services. </dd>
